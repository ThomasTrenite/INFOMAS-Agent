# INFOMAS-Agent
Creating the best negotiation agent for INFOMAS Course.

## The safest, least problematic way to do this:
- Given that genius is already working on your pc, copy all contents of src from this repo into your local src folder. 
- Open src/caduceusdc16/Cadac1.java

- Add class file to genius.

If you get an error make sure the project has access to genius and the other folders (i.e. bilateralexample)

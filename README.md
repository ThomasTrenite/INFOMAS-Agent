# INFOMAS-Agent
Creating the best negotiation agent for INFOMAS Course.

## The safest, least problematic way to do this:
- Given that genius is already working on your pc, copy all contents of src from this repo into your local src folder. 
- Open src/caduceusdc16/CadacDC1.java
- Build
- Run
- Add class file to genius.

If you get an error make sure the project has access to genius and the other folders (i.e. bilateralexample)


If you absolutely must run it and don't have time to sort out compilation bug, Copy the .class file in `out/Production/PleaseWork/Caduceusdc16/` and place it into your `out` file


### To do:
- Add Decoupled agents
- Add dynamic weight updates
- Add method of selecting agents

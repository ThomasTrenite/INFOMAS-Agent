Creating the best negotiation agent for INFOMAS Course.

## The safest, least problematic way to do this:
- Given that genius is already working on your pc, copy all contents of src from this repo into your local src folder. 
- Open src/caduceusdc16/boacomponents/Group5_BS.java
- Build
- Run
- Add boa components to genius.
- Build Boa party with the components
- Restart genius
- Run a tournament.

If you get an error make sure the project has access to genius and the other folders.
